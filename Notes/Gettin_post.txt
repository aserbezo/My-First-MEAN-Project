Dependenci Injection = to get service to the component 

We need to create a seperate ts file post.service.ts

import { Post } from "./post.models";


export class PostsService{
 private posts: Post[] = []

 getPosts(){
   return [...this.posts]
 }

 addPost(title:string,content:string){
   const post: Post = {title: title , content: content }
   this.posts.push(post)

 }
}

we created that file in order to able to combine the get post function
