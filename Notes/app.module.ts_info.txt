An Angular module class describes how the application parts fit together.
Every application has at least one Angular module, 
the root module that you bootstrap to launch the application. 
You can call it anything you want. 
The conventional name is AppModule.

LINE 1 to 4 After the import statements, you come to a class adorned with the @NgModule decorator.

The @NgModule decorator identifies AppModule as an Angular module class (also called an NgModule class). 
@NgModule takes a metadata object that tells Angular how to compile and launch the application.

imports — the BrowserModule that this and every application needs to run in a browser,
declarations — the application's lone component,
bootstrap — the root component that Angular creates and inserts into the index.html host web page.
