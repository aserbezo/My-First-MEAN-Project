We need to send http request 

we need to import HttpClientModule from angular common http  in app.ts in angular

we are ussing post.service.ts 


to listen we need to subscribe(), for obsever features build in angular is not need to subscribe

for data , for errors and complite.

// this way we are injecting the httpclient in the function
constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient){}

 getPosts(){
   this.httpClient.get<{message: string, posts: Post[]}>('http://localhost:3000/api/posts')
   .subscribe( (postData)=> {
    this.posts = postData.posts
    this.postsUpdated.next([...this.posts])
   })
 }

 we will face CORS
